| Sep 6? | 5:15-6:45pm |                                                                                       I worked with Deven. We figured how to know if the board is even winnable. We did this by first seeing if there were 6 snakes in a row, then seeing if there was a ladder which could avoid the snakes. |
| Sep 8  | 5:30-6:45pm | I worked with Deven. A lot of our time wasn't spent coding, we spent a lot of time thinking about how we were going to implement bfs for the puzzle. We figured out how we would do this, and started by creating arrays to figure out if the cell had a snake/ladder or was already visited. |
shift enter doesn't work for some reason for me, I was unable to add a new cell: Date Sep 10. Time 7:00-8:00. Update: I implemented my variables and helper methods from last work seesion to create a working bfs. I figured out how to do the bfs using the psuedocode originally, which I then updated and restructured to fit my purpose. On the way, I changed some of my old code in the helper methods to either correct them or make the functions easier to use.


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
