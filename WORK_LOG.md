We did this by first seeing if there were 6 snakes in a row, then seeing if there was a ladder which could avoid the snakes. |
| Sep 8 | 5:30-6:45pm | I worked with Deven. A lot of our time wasn't spent coding, we spent a lot of time thinking about how we were going to implement bfs for the puzzle. We figured out how we would do this, and started by creating arrays to figure out if the cell had a snake/ladder or was already visited. |
